# **Blueprint: High-Performance Proxy Server in Rust**

## **Goal**
Develop a high-performance **HTTP/HTTPS proxy server** in **Rust** using **Actix-Web** that dynamically routes requests based on the `X-Proxy-To` header. The proxy should efficiently handle **100,000+ concurrent requests** with low latency and minimal memory overhead.

---

## **Requirements**
### **1. Functional Requirements**
- Accepts **HTTP and HTTPS** requests from clients.
- Extracts the `X-Proxy-To` header to determine the upstream proxy.
- Supports **authentication** in the upstream proxy (e.g., `user:password@proxy:port`).
- Efficiently proxies requests, preserving headers and body.
- Uses **connection pooling** to improve performance.
- Handles **timeouts** and **retries** gracefully.
- Supports **streaming responses** to prevent memory overflows.
- Provides **logging and metrics** for monitoring.
- Can be deployed via **Docker** and scaled horizontally.

### **2. Non-Functional Requirements**
- **High performance**: Optimized for **low latency (<10ms per request)**.
- **Memory efficiency**: Minimal resource footprint compared to traditional proxies.
- **Security**: Properly handles **TLS, headers sanitization, and request validation**.
- **Scalability**: Supports **horizontal scaling** via load balancing (e.g., NGINX/Kubernetes).
- **Observability**: Integrates with **Prometheus/Grafana** for monitoring.

## **Steps to Achieve the Goal**
### **1. Project Initialization**
- [ ] Create a new Rust project: `cargo new proxy-server`
- [ ] Add dependencies (`actix-web`, `reqwest`, `tokio`, `serde`, `tracing`)
- [ ] Configure `Cargo.toml` with optimized compiler flags

### **2. Implement Core Proxy Logic**
- [ ] Set up **Actix-Web** as the main web server.
- [ ] Extract `X-Proxy-To` from incoming requests.
- [ ] Validate and parse `X-Proxy-To` (handle invalid formats).
- [ ] Use **`reqwest`** to forward the request to the upstream proxy.
- [ ] Forward request **headers, body, and query parameters**.
- [ ] Preserve **HTTP methods** (GET, POST, PUT, etc.).
- [ ] Implement **response streaming** (prevent buffering large responses in memory).

### **3. Performance Optimizations**
- [ ] Use **`Arc<HttpClient>`** for **connection pooling**.
- [ ] Enable **async streaming** to handle large payloads.
- [ ] Configure **timeouts and retries**.
- [ ] Optimize **DNS resolution** via `trust-dns`.
- [ ] Implement **gzip/brotli compression** for efficient data transfer.

### **4. Error Handling & Resilience**
- [ ] Handle **timeouts** and **connection failures** gracefully.
- [ ] Implement **rate limiting** to prevent abuse.
- [ ] Add **request validation** to avoid malformed upstream proxy requests.
- [ ] Ensure **graceful shutdown** and connection cleanup.

### **5. Logging & Observability**
- [ ] Integrate **`tracing`** for structured logging.
- [ ] Add **Prometheus metrics** for monitoring request latency & throughput.
- [ ] Provide **detailed error logs** for debugging.
- [ ] Expose a **health check endpoint** (`/health`).

### **6. Dockerization & Deployment**
- [ ] Create a `Dockerfile` for easy deployment.
- [ ] Use **multi-stage builds** to keep the final image small.
- [ ] Deploy behind **NGINX for load balancing**.
- [ ] Configure **Kubernetes manifests** for auto-scaling.

### **7. Testing & Benchmarking**
- [ ] Write **unit tests** for proxy logic.
- [ ] Implement **integration tests** using a mock upstream proxy.
- [ ] Use **`wrk` or `vegeta`** for benchmarking under **high load**.
- [ ] Tune performance based on test results.

## **Notes for LLM Code Generators**
- Use **`actix-web`** as the main framework.
- Optimize for **async performance** (`tokio`, `reqwest` with `HttpClient` pooling).
- Follow **Rust best practices** (zero-cost abstractions, efficient memory usage).
- Implement **logging & monitoring hooks** (e.g., `tracing`, `metrics`).
- Consider **containerization & cloud deployment** early.

## **Next Steps**
1. Start coding with `cargo new proxy-server`.
2. Implement the **core proxy logic** (handle `X-Proxy-To`).
3. Optimize **performance & memory usage**.
4. Deploy **to Docker & Kubernetes**.
5. Benchmark & tune the proxy for high-load scenarios.

Goal: A Rust-based proxy that can handle 100,000+ concurrent requests efficiently.
